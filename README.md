# D3DataVisProjectOnIrishRevenueData
Irish Revenue Data would be visualized using D3. javascript library

In this project, 
1. Main Data file: net-receipts-by-county.csv.
2. Split the data by year using Data_Vis.R.
3. Other CSVs are year wise spillted data, that has been used in index.html.
4. index.html is purely coded using d3.min.js library.
5. Check the images of the visualization 

Thanks
